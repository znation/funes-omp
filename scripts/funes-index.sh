# omp's automation: advance funes's index over this agent's spool and, at a session boundary,
# publish it. The extension converts each turn itself and spawns this script detached, so the work is
# done in place — nothing here waits on a hook.
#
#   funes-index.sh                     per turn: index
#   funes-index.sh --publish [MEMORY]  at a boundary: index, waiting out a per-turn run that still
#                                      holds the memory lock, then push to MEMORY — or to the memory
#                                      `setup add` recorded beside this script
#
# No locking: `funes` serializes local-memory writes itself. A per-turn run that loses the lock
# exits non-zero, is logged, and the next turn re-sweeps the same content — indexing is idempotent.
